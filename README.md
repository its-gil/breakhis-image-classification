### Drop magnification column from the original CSV?

### Q1: What about class computers for training?? Maybe better??
I believe all of our laptop have Intel Iris... So we are better off with Collab's Nvidia I suppose. Or maybe class computers??

### Q2: How to handle the HUGE amount of data?
about 4GB comprimated => about **30 GB** to handle for the whole process... no point in pushing that to the repository ofc.

### Q3: is it a good approach to scale down the data?
loss of information?

### Q4: idea - is it a good approach to uniformize the color of the samples?
