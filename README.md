# BreaKHis binary and multi-class image classification for breast cancer recognition

The dataset can be downloaded here: http://www.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/BreaKHis_v1.tar.gz ;

1. Please download the dataset and put it into *this workspace*. This is critical for step 2 to work.
2. Run the python script 'Preprocess_csv_and_build_file_structure' in './utils' to generate a file index and structure for the images. The creation of the file structure will take a while, because the images have to be scaled down and copied all into the same directory.
3. Run the binary or multi-class models under '/models'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: ensure that the file paths present in the code are adjusted to your workspace!
